  Y,
  block,

\arguments{
\item{Z}{A numeric vector of treatment assignment. 0 indicates control and 1 treated.}

\item{Y}{A numeric vector contains response values of the group.}

\item{block}{A factor vector indicates to which blocks the units belong.}

\item{k}{A parameter in hypothesis test that at least k units have treatment effects less or equal to c}

\item{c}{A parameter in hypothesis test that at least k units have treatment effects less or equal to c}

\item{gam}{A parameter for sensitivity analysis}

\item{method.list.all}{A list that contains the method of the rank scores. It might vary among different blocks}

\item{opt.method}{Algorithm that is used for optimization. Available algorithms are "Greedy", "DP", "Mcknap, "LP", "ILP".}

\item{ties}{A subvector of c("upper", "lower", "fix") indicating which tie-dealing methods we use to calculate p-values. "upper" will use the method that will produce maximum p-value, while "lower" will get minimum. "fix" however will order the ties the same way as "first" method in rank function.}

\item{switch}{Logical variable. If true, the function uses switching treatment and control trick when calculating p-value.}
}
\description{
A function to calculate valid p-value for null hypothesis: kth smallest treatment effect is less or equal to c.
